##### This app displays tables containing data, obtained from PhosPhAt, regarding protein phosphorylation sites. There is a table in each tab, and upon entering a transcript identifier, all three tables are populated with data. The "Experimental" tab displays phosphorylation sites that were experimentally determined. The "Predicted" tab displays phosphorylation sites that was computationally predicted. Lastly, the "Hotspots" tab displays computationally predicted phosphorylation hotspots.

> The Arabidopsis Protein Phosphorylation Site Database (PhosPhAt 4.0) contains information on Arabidopsis phosphorylation sites which were identified by mass spectrometry in large scale experiments by different research groups. Specific information about the peptide properties, their annotated biological function as well as the experimental and analytical context is given. . . . The PhosPhAt service has a built-in plant specific phosphorylation site predictor trained on the experimental dataset for Serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation.

### Instructions:

##### To get started, enter a transcript identifier in the input field labeled "Transcript ID". An example of a valid transcript ID is provided below the search box. Once the search button is clicked the tables in all three tabs will be loaded with data. Next to each tab name is the number of data entries that table contains. You can click on any of the tabs to view that table.

Additonal Features:

*   Typing in the upper-right input field labeled "Narrow results:" allows for the data in that table to be searched.
*   Clicking the table headers allows the table to be sorted in ascending or descending order.
*   Dragging the table headers allows for the columns to be rearranged.
*   The number of entries shown at once can be changed with the dropdown in the upper-left.

#### Possible Issues:

*   A valid transcript ID is composed of a locus ID and a number identifying its isomer. For example, AT1G01540.1 and AT1G01540.2 are both valid transcript IDs with the same locus ID (AT1G01540).
*   If an invalid transcript ID is entered a red error message is displayed below the search box.
*   A transcript ID may return data for one, all, or none of the tabs. If a table has zero entries, it means no data was returned.
